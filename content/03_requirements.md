# Specific Requirements  

This section lists all verifiable requirements of the GKCMS platform, divided into functional and non-functional categories. Each requirement is identified by a unique code for traceability. Supporting rationale or references are provided where relevant.  

### 3.1 Functional Requirements  

**REQ-001 - Schema Management Interface:** The system **shall provide** a user interface (UI) and/or API endpoints for administrators to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on content type schemas. This includes defining new schema entities with a name and a set of fields (with types and constraints), modifying existing schemas (e.g. adding or removing fields), and deleting schemas that are no longer needed (provided no active content depends on them). Schemas are versioned or tracked such that changes can be auditable. Schema definitions are persisted in the Schema Store (A).  

**REQ-002 - Schema-Validated Authoring:** The system **shall enforce schema validation** during content authoring or ingestion. When a content author inputs data for a new content item (or when an external content piece is ingested), the system must validate that the content conforms to the selected schema's structure and data types, and that all required fields as per the schema are present. If any field is missing or of an incorrect type, or a value violates a schema-defined constraint (e.g. length limit, enumerated value, etc.), the system will reject the content save with a clear error message indicating the validation issue. This ensures content integrity and consistency across the platform [oai_citation:21â€¡chrisdaaz.github.io](https://chrisdaaz.github.io/static-web-scholcomm/tutorials/static-site-generators/#:~:text=YAML%20syntax%20is%20strict%3B%20invalid,an%20error%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20understand). *(For example, if the schema "FAQ' requires a question and answer, the author cannot save an FAQ content item without providing an answer field.)*  

**REQ-003 - Rule Management and Enforcement:** The system **shall allow** administrators to create and manage content validation rules separate from schema structure (via the Rule Management Interface, module 7.0). These rules can encode business logic or content quality checks (e.g. "Titles must be unique across all Articles' or "If content is of type X and field Y has value Z, field W must not be empty'). The system **shall enforce** these rules on content submissions (whether via UI or ingestion pipeline) by evaluating each relevant rule against the content. If a rule condition is not satisfied, the content will be rejected or flagged with a rule-specific error message. Rule definitions are stored in the Rule Store (C) and can be enabled/disabled by admins. *(For example, a rule could ensure no two glossary terms have the same definition text in the Data Dictionary, preventing duplicate definitions.)*  

**REQ-004 - Content Creation & Editing:** The system **shall provide** a content creation/editing module (1.0) for authors to input new content and modify existing content. This interface should support: selecting a content type (schema) for new content, presenting appropriate input fields (text boxes, drop-downs, etc.) for each schema field, and allowing rich text editing for fields that require formatted text (likely using Markdown syntax for formatting). The UI shall allow authors to add relevant tags/terms to the content (for instance, by choosing from the controlled terminology list or by highlighting text to tag entities). The system must perform on-the-fly validation as per REQ-002 and REQ-003 when possible, or at least upon submission. On successful creation or edit, the content item is saved (triggering the enrichment and load pipeline - see REQ-008, REQ-009). The system shall maintain version control of content: each content item will have a version number that increments on each edit, and the provenance (timestamp and user) of changes will be recorded (audit trail).  

**REQ-005 - Content Ingestion Pipeline:** The system **shall provide** an ingestion mechanism (2.0) to import content from external sources in bulk or individually. This may be realized as a command-line tool, scheduled job, or admin-initiated process. The ingestion pipeline will accept content in a defined input format (e.g. Markdown files with YAML front matter, JSON files, or via an API endpoint that accepts content payloads). **Parsing (2.1)** and **structural validation (2.2)** of input are required steps (mapping input fields to the internal schema, and validating as per schema). The system shall log any ingestion errors (with details such as which item failed and why) to the Telemetry store (I) for operator review. The ingestion process must ensure idempotency or uniqueness: if the same content item is ingested twice, the system should detect duplicate (REQ-008) rather than creating a double entry. Additionally, the ingestion can be configured to run with certain transformations (e.g. if source uses slightly different field names, a mapping to GKCMS schema fields can be applied). *(Example: ingesting a batch of blog posts exported from WordPress - GKCMS should map WordPress fields to its own schema and import all posts.)*  

**REQ-006 - Terminology Management:** The system **shall provide** functionality (via module 9.0 UI or API) to manage terminology - i.e., the list of domain terms that content can be tagged with. Admins can add new terms, edit term names or descriptions, and remove terms. Terms can also be flagged as active/inactive if needed. The system shall prevent exact duplicate terms from being added (or if allowed, it must handle synonyms distinctly). Each term in the Terminology Store (E) may have attributes such as a definition, synonyms, and an associated category (if an ontology category). Terms managed here are used by the enrichment process for tagging (REQ-009).  

**REQ-007 - Ontology Management:** The system **shall enable** administrators to manage the domain ontology (module 10.0). This includes defining categories and subcategories, and linking terms into this hierarchy. Specifically, admins can create a "Category' node, and then assign terms under that category or create subcategory nodes. The interface should allow visualizing the hierarchy (e.g. tree view) if possible. The ontology structure is stored in the Ontology Store (F) and reflected in the Knowledge Graph (H). The system shall support importing an ontology from a standard format (e.g. OWL or CSV of parent-child relations) to ease initial setup - if an import is done, it should create all corresponding nodes and relationships internally. Conversely, an export feature (to CSV or OWL) is desirable for backup or editing outside. The ontology design decisions (like whether to treat categories as just terms with a "category' flag or a separate entity) should be hidden from the admin; they see it logically. The system should ensure no cycles are introduced (it should enforce that the category graph is acyclic if intended to be a hierarchy). Terms and categories managed in the ontology are used in tagging and on the static site for organizing content.  

**REQ-008 - Duplicate Detection:** During content processing, the system **shall detect duplicate content items** to avoid unintended redundancy. A "duplicate' may be defined by a unique key (like an externally provided ID, or a combination of title+schema, etc.) or by content similarity (e.g. identical text). At minimum, if an ingestion provides an ID that already exists in the Document Store, the system should treat it as an update or skip it (configurable). Additionally, the system can use checksums or hashing of content to catch exact duplicates. If a duplicate is found: for manual authoring, the user should be warned (e.g. "A content item with this title exists, do you want to create anyway?'); for ingestion, a policy can be set to skip or update duplicates. Deduplication logic is part of Enrichment (3.1) and should be efficient (e.g. looking up a hash in an index rather than scanning all content). The outcome of deduping (skipped or merged items) should be logged.  

**REQ-009 - Content Enrichment (Tagging & Embeddings):** The system **shall automatically enrich** content items upon creation or ingestion with the following sub-functions:  
- **REQ-009a (Entity/Term Tagging):** The system shall analyze the content's text to identify occurrences of known terms from the terminology store (E) and any other significant entities (like names, places if relevant to domain). For each recognized term/entity, the system will associate the corresponding Term ID with the content (effectively tagging it). This could be done via simple keyword matching or NLP algorithms for entity recognition. The tagging respects term boundaries (e.g., avoid partial matches) and can handle synonyms (if synonyms are defined, tagging might map them to a canonical term). The result is that each content item ends up with a set of tags linking it to Term entities. This tagging is stored as relationships in the knowledge graph and possibly as a list in the content's document record. Example: If an article contains "machine learning', and "Machine Learning' is a term in the glossary, the content is tagged with that term ID. The system should ensure tags are relevant (could ignore overly common terms if a stop-list is configured).  
- **REQ-009b (Semantic Embedding Generation):** The system shall generate a semantic vector embedding for each content item using an AI model (such as a sentence transformer or embedding API). The embedding should capture the meaning of the content (e.g., an average of paragraph embeddings or a specific embedding of a representative text like title+summary). This vector is then stored in a vector index (e.g., Weaviate) associated with the content's ID. Embeddings enable semantic search queries where results with similar meaning are found even if exact keywords differ. The process should be efficient; if using an external model, it should batch requests if needed. The system may skip embedding for extremely short content or as configurable. Also, if content is updated, its embedding should be regenerated (either synchronously or queued).  

- **REQ-009c (Metadata Augmentation):** *[Optional]* The system can enrich content with additional metadata, such as computing an SEO-friendly summary, or extracting key sentences, or linking to related content items (this could be done by checking other content with overlapping tags and adding references). While not explicitly requested in prompt, such enrichment might be beneficial. If implemented, it should follow similar pipeline: analyze content, produce metadata (like "related_content_ids'), and store it.  

Enrichment must run in a way that doesn't block user too long. For authors in UI, enrichment might happen just after saving (and not necessarily delay the save confirmation beyond basic validation). For ingestion, it can be done in streaming or batch after initial load. The system should be designed such that enrichment can be re-run on content if needed (for example, if the ontology is updated, one might want to re-tag content using new terms - the system could support a re-enrichment job).  

**REQ-010 - Content Storage (Dual Model):** The system **shall store** each content item in two primary forms:  
- **REQ-010a (Document Form):** as a structured document in YAML or JSON format, capturing all its fields and content body. This is stored in the Document Store (G), which could be a database (like a MongoDB document) or a flat file with front matter. The format should preserve the content exactly as authored (including Markdown formatting for the body, if applicable). This storage is the source of truth for content textual data and is used by the static site generator (REQ-013).  
- **REQ-010b (Graph Form):** as nodes (and relationships) in the Knowledge Graph (H). Each content becomes a node labeled e.g. "Content' with properties (like id, title, date, etc.). It is connected to other nodes: at least to the terms it was tagged with (Term nodes), possibly to an Author node (if tracking authorship), to its Schema node, and any other relevant connections (e.g., if content references another content, could be a relationship too). This graph representation is used for complex queries and to maintain the knowledge network. The system must ensure that when content is created, updated, or deleted, both the document form and graph form are synchronized. (E.g., on content deletion, remove or mark obsolete the graph node and its edges as well as the document entry).  

Additionally, the embedding (vector) is stored alongside or within the graph; practically using Weaviate means content objects are stored with vector embeddings - so an object in Weaviate might serve as both document and vector store. However, since we treat them conceptually separate, the requirement is to store vectors in an index that can be queried by similarity. The content's unique identifier links these forms (graph node and vector and document all share an ID).  

**REQ-011 - Static Site Generation:** The system **shall generate a static website** from the content in the platform, reflecting the latest published content. This involves:  
- **REQ-011a:** For each content item of certain schemas (configurable which schemas appear on site; e.g. all public-facing ones), produce an HTML page. Use templates for each schema to format the content fields into HTML (for instance, a "Tutorial' schema might have a template that puts title as `<h1>`, body in `<div>`, etc.). The Markdown content should be converted to HTML, and any internal references (like images or links) resolved.  
- **REQ-011b:** Embed JSON-LD metadata within each page that describes the content in structured form (leveraging schema.org vocab where possible). For example, an Article page might include a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block with JSON-LD that contains the article's title, author, date, and topics (terms) as structured data [oai_citation:22â€¡yext.com](https://www.yext.com/platform/content#:~:text=). The JSON-LD context may also reference the ontology (e.g., including a taxonomy category in the metadata). This makes the site content machine-readable by search engine crawlers or any AI agent ingesting the site.  
- **REQ-011c:** Generate listing pages or an index as needed. For example, a homepage listing latest articles, or category pages listing content by category. These pages ensure navigability. Category pages might use the ontology: e.g. a page for each top-level category that lists all content tagged with terms under that category.  
- **REQ-011d:** The static site generator should produce output that is easily deployable (a folder of static files). It might also integrate with a deploy step (like pushing to a git repo or cloud storage).  
- **REQ-011e:** The static site generation must be able to run incrementally or on-demand. For instance, when a content item is published or updated, the system could regenerate that page (and any listing pages it affects) automatically. Or at least flag that a rebuild is needed. The site generation can also be run in full (rebuild all) periodically or via admin trigger.  

The static site output will be stored in the Website store (J) - which might be a directory on disk or a cloud bucket. The site should be optimized for performance (e.g., can include search index precomputed, minified assets, etc., though those specifics may be considered later). 

**REQ-012 - Search and Query Interface:** The platform **shall provide** robust querying capabilities to end users and external systems:  
- **REQ-012a (Full-Text Search):** Users (via the site's search box or via API) can search for content by keywords. The system shall retrieve content items that contain those keywords in important fields (title, body, tags, etc.). This likely involves an index (maybe leveraging Weaviate's built-in keyword search, or another search engine integration). The results should be ranked by relevance.  
- **REQ-012b (Semantic Search):** The system shall offer semantic search using the embeddings. When a search query is provided, the system will generate an embedding for the query (using the same model as content embedding) and then find nearest-neighbor vectors among content embeddings [oai_citation:23â€¡weaviate.io](https://weaviate.io/learn/knowledgecards#:~:text=Weaviate%20Knowledge%20Cards%20Databases%20designed,data%20like%20text%20and%20images). This returns content that is semantically similar to the query, even if exact words differ. For example, a search for "AI training techniques' might return content tagged with "machine learning' even if that phrase wasn't in the query. This feature is exposed to the UI (blended with normal results or as a separate option) and via API endpoints.  
- **REQ-012c (Filtered/Browsing Queries):** Users should be able to filter content by facets like schema type, category, date range, etc. The query interface shall support filtering mechanisms. E.g., an API call might allow `?type=Tutorial&tag=Python` to get all content of schema "Tutorial' tagged with "Python'. On the static site, this could manifest as category pages or filter UI. The system's knowledge graph can be utilized to resolve hierarchical filters (if user filters by a top category, include content tagged with any term under it).  
- **REQ-012d (Graph Queries for Admins/Advanced):** The platform shall allow authorized users to run more complex queries over the knowledge graph - e.g., find relationships or run an analytic query. This could be via an admin console or API endpoints that accept graph query language (like Cypher or GraphQL). This is more for internal use or advanced integrations (for example, an admin might query "show me all orphan terms that no content is tagged with'). This requirement may be met by providing Neo4j's interface to admins or implementing some query endpoints.  
- **REQ-012e (Response Format):** The query interface will return results in an appropriate format. For UI, it's HTML pages or a JSON used by search page script. For API, JSON responses with content details (and maybe knowledge graph context if requested). If it's a semantic query, results should include a relevance score. If via API, follow REST conventions (e.g. GET /search?q=â€¦ returns a JSON list of matching content items with essential fields).  

**REQ-013 - RESTful API:** The GKCMS **shall expose** a REST API (module 11.0/endpoint K) that allows external systems or clients to interact with the platform. Key API endpoints include:  
- **Content Retrieval:** e.g. `GET /api/content/{id}` to fetch a content item's details (including its fields, tags, maybe even related items). Also endpoints to list content with pagination and filtering (e.g. `GET /api/content?type=Article&tag=AI`).  
- **Content Query/Search:** e.g. `GET /api/search?query=...` which returns search results (leveraging REQ-012 under the hood). Possibly separate endpoints for semantic search vs keyword search or combined results with flags.  
- **Content Creation/Update:** e.g. `POST /api/content` to create a new content (with JSON body containing fields), `PUT /api/content/{id}` to update. These should enforce same validation rules as the UI (REQ-002, REQ-003). In the PoC, this might be open or minimal, but in production, these write endpoints should require authentication (and likely only accessible to certain roles or system-to-system integration).  
- **Schema and Config Access:** Possibly GET endpoints to retrieve schemas (`/api/schema/{name}`) or list terms (`/api/terms?category=xyz`). This might be necessary for external tools that need to know the structure or to present choices (for example, a custom authoring tool could call `/api/terms` to get list of terms for an autocomplete).  
- **Monitoring/Health:** A `GET /api/health` endpoint shall exist to allow health checks (returns a simple status). Also, if not using Prometheus, an admin-only endpoint to get metrics might exist.  
The API should follow standard HTTP semantics: use appropriate response codes (200 success, 400 for validation fail, etc.), and return structured error messages in case of errors (e.g., with error code and description).  

**REQ-014 - OAuth2 Authentication & Authorization:** The system's API (and any sensitive UI endpoints) **shall be secured** via OAuth 2.0 in production deployments. This means:  
- The system will trust an external OAuth2 identity provider (e.g., an organization's SSO or a service like Auth0) for authenticating users and issuing tokens.  
- **REQ-014a:** The API shall require a valid OAuth2 access token on all requests that modify data (and on read requests for non-public data). Tokens will be sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The system shall validate tokens - either by verifying JWT signatures or by introspecting via the IdP - to ensure they are not expired and are issued by the trusted provider.  
- **REQ-014b:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) shall be implemented: Each token or user has roles/claims (for example, a claim "role:admin' or scopes like "read:content', "write:content'). The system shall allow or deny access to specific API endpoints based on these roles/scopes. E.g., only users with "admin' role can use schema management endpoints, only those with "editor' or "admin' can POST new content, whereas GET public content might be allowed to "visitor' role or no auth if content is public. The exact mapping of roles to permissions will be defined, aligning with user classes (Section 2.3).  
- **REQ-014c:** In the authoring UI (if web), if a login is required, the system should support OAuth2 flows (like authorization code flow) to log the user in and obtain a token. The token is then used for API calls from the UI. The PoC might skip this, but design ensures it can be added (through configuration and adding required libraries).  
- **REQ-014d:** Audit Trails: The system shall log authentication and authorization events (especially admin actions). For instance, when an admin updates a schema via API, the log should record the admin's user ID and what was changed. These logs go to Telemetry store (I) and can be reviewed for security auditing.  

This requirement addresses security to meet OWASP ASVS L2 best practices by ensuring proper auth is in place [oai_citation:24â€¡versprite.com](https://versprite.com/blog/software-development-life-cycle/#:~:text=Level%201%20%E2%80%93%20First%20step%2C,verify%20with%20black%20box%20testing). In PoC environment, the auth can be turned off or use a dummy token, but in production it's mandatory.  

**REQ-015 - Telemetry & Monitoring:** The GKCMS **shall implement** extensive telemetry for observability. Specifically:  
- **REQ-015a (Logging):** All significant events and errors in the system shall be logged. This includes user actions (content create, update, delete with user info), system actions (ingestion job started/finished, site build done), and errors/exceptions (with stack traces if internal error). Logs should use a structured format if possible (JSON logs or key=value) for easier parsing. Sensitive info (like passwords or tokens) must not be logged. The logging level should be configurable (debug, info, warn, error). By default, production runs at info or higher. *Target:* At least 99% of operations have some trace in the logs, ensuring traceability for debugging [oai_citation:25â€¡lumigo.io](https://lumigo.io/what-is-distributed-tracing/distributed-tracing-in-microservices-the-basics-and-4-tools-you-should-know-about/#:~:text=Distributed%20Tracing%20in%20Microservices%3A%20Basics,travels%20across%20a%20monitored).  
- **REQ-015b (Distributed Tracing):** The system shall tag log entries or use a tracing system so that a single transaction (e.g., an API request through enrichment pipeline) can be traced end-to-end. This might involve including a correlation ID for each request that is passed to internal calls and DB queries. If using OpenTelemetry or similar, the system can produce spans for critical sections (like parse, validate, enrich, save) that can be collected. This aids achieving the 99% traceability by reconstructing request flows.  
- **REQ-015c (Metrics):** Key performance and health metrics shall be recorded and made accessible. This includes metrics like: number of requests per second (by endpoint), request latency (avg, 95th percentile), number of content writes per minute (to verify meeting â‰¥10k requirement), DB query timings, queue lengths for any background tasks, memory/CPU usage, etc. The system will expose these metrics through a Prometheus endpoint (`/metrics`) following Prometheus format. At minimum: request_count_total, request_duration_seconds, content_items_total, etc., and custom metrics for any important process (like "ingestion_items_processed_total').  
- **REQ-015d (Alerts & SLA monitoring):** The system should allow setting thresholds on metrics for alerting (though the actual alerting might be done by external monitoring). For example, if average read latency exceeds 150ms over 5 minutes, or if writes drop below expected rate, etc., an alert could be triggered. While not implemented in code, the design should ensure the needed metrics exist for external tools to monitor SLA compliance.  
- **REQ-015e (Monitoring UI):** Optionally, the platform could offer a simple status dashboard for admins showing basic info (like number of content, recent errors, etc.), but primarily it relies on integration with tools like Grafana for visualizing metrics.  

All telemetry data will be stored in Telemetry/Logs (I). The architecture should ensure logs from all components (API server, static builder, etc.) end up in a unified sink (e.g., with a logging agent in deployment).  

**REQ-016 - Performance Targets:** The system **shall meet** the following performance requirements (quantitative):  
- **REQ-016a (Write Throughput):** The content pipeline (from submission to stored) shall support at least **10,000 content writes per minute**. This means if 10k new content items are ingested in one minute, the system can process them (validate, enrich, store) within that minute (or shortly after, a small acceptable lag for final indexing perhaps). This can be measured by a load test. Achieving this may involve concurrency; the requirement stands that overall throughput is 10k/min (~167 per second).  
- **REQ-016b (Read Latency):** Retrieval of content via the API or site search shall have **response times â‰¤ 150 milliseconds** for typical queries under normal load (not counting network latency to client). This applies to a simple content fetch by ID or a straightforward search query. More complex graph queries may be slower, but any user-facing query should ideally be sub-150ms in median latency. 150ms is quite fast; presumably a cached or indexed path. The system might use caching to help. If the DB is tuned and content sizes moderate, a direct DB fetch can be within this. Note: static site pages are served as static files and thus can be <50ms from a CDN, so end-user site browsing is very fast. The 150ms is more for API responses or dynamic search results.  
- **REQ-016c (Concurrent Users):** The system shall support **400 concurrent users** performing read operations (page views or API GETs) without significant degradation (e.g., still maintaining <150ms latency for most). This likely requires horizontal scaling - thus the system should be stateless at the API layer to allow adding instances. For write operations, it should handle at least a few dozen concurrent authors or 1 heavy ingestion job without issues (10 concurrent might be okay given 10 agents specified).  
- **REQ-016d (Static Build Frequency):** The static site generator should be efficient enough to rebuild the entire site (assuming O(1000) content pages for example) within a reasonable time (say < 5 minutes). Partial builds (for one page change) should take seconds. This ensures timely content publishing once authored.  

These performance targets will be verified with test scenarios. If any target is not met, the system will need optimization or scaling.  

**REQ-017 - Scalability & Portability:** The system **shall be designed to scale** horizontally and be portable across environments:  
- **REQ-017a (Horizontal Scaling):** It shall be possible to run multiple instances of the API server behind a load balancer to handle increased load. No in-memory state in the API that can't be shared, aside from caching which can be replicated or externalized (if using an in-memory cache, it should be a distributed cache or okay to have per instance). The databases chosen (Neo4j, Weaviate) should support clustering or at least handle more load by scaling up. If one instance of API can handle ~100 concurrent users, four instances should handle 400, etc. The ingestion pipeline might be parallelized if needed (maybe splitting input among multiple workers).  
- **REQ-017b (Docker Support):** The application shall be containerized via Docker. A Dockerfile will be provided for the API app. Docker images for databases will be used as per official images. The system shall run under Docker Compose (for simple setups) and Kubernetes (for robust, scalable deployments). The documentation will include how to deploy on these. All configurations (DB URLs, credentials, etc.) shall be externalized to environment variables or config files, not hard-coded, to allow flexible deployment.  
- **REQ-017c (Cloud Portability):** The system shall not depend on any one cloud provider's proprietary services, so it can be run on AWS, Azure, GCP or on-premises with equal functionality. (Using managed database services is optional, but since using open-source DB, that's portable anyway). Logging and monitoring integration use open formats (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry) which are cloud-agnostic.  

**REQ-018 - Security and Compliance:** The system **shall implement** security controls to meet OWASP ASVS Level 2 requirements [oai_citation:26â€¡versprite.com](https://versprite.com/blog/software-development-life-cycle/#:~:text=Level%201%20%E2%80%93%20First%20step%2C,verify%20with%20black%20box%20testing):  
- **REQ-018a:** Protect against common web vulnerabilities - e.g., perform input sanitization/encoding to prevent XSS when displaying content (especially user-generated content like an author's input could have script; we must sanitize or use an allowlist for Markdown HTML if any). Prevent injection attacks - all database queries (Cypher, etc.) must use parameterized queries, not string concat, to avoid injection.  
- **REQ-018b:** Use secure communication - API should be deployed behind HTTPS. If any user credentials or tokens are in transit, they must be over TLS.  
- **REQ-018c:** Implement strong authentication (via OAuth2 as above) and ensure session management is not applicable (since it's token-based stateless).  
- **REQ-018d:** Implement access control checks on all functions - e.g., even if UI hides a button, the API must enforce that an unauthorized role can't call an admin endpoint.  
- **REQ-018e:** Audit logging (as mentioned) for security-relevant events (logins, permission failures, data changes) is enabled.  
- **REQ-018f:** Provide an admin mechanism to manage user roles if needed (this might be done via the external IdP, but GKCMS might have to enforce additional domain-specific roles, so either rely on token claims or have an internal user-role mapping).  
- **REQ-018g:** Ensure data protection - if any sensitive data fields exist, consider encryption at rest or masking in logs. Content itself might not be sensitive, but audit logs might contain user info, which should be protected.  

- **REQ-018h:** Provide an **Audit Trail interface** for admins to review changes: e.g., a log of content changes (who changed what and when). This can be a simple log file or an admin UI that shows recent changes.  
- **REQ-018i:** The system should be configurable to comply with privacy laws if needed (like ability to delete user data on request, etc., if any personal data is stored).  

**REQ-019 - KPI/SLA Monitoring and Reporting:** To ensure service quality, the system **shall define and track key performance indicators (KPIs)** and support service level agreements (SLAs) as follows:  
- **REQ-019a:** The system's operators (admins/devOps) shall define baseline values for critical KPIs such as average response time, error rate, throughput, uptime percentage. These baselines will be established by measuring the system under normal expected load (e.g. after initial deployment, measure average search latency, etc.) [oai_citation:27â€¡radview.com](https://www.radview.com/blog/in-the-spotlight-the-sla-for-performance-and-load-testing/#:~:text=application%20will%20perform%20under%20excessive,foundation%20data%20for%20performance%20SLAs).  
- **REQ-019b:** The system shall produce reports or live metrics such that these KPIs can be monitored over time. For example, it could integrate with a dashboard (Grafana) to show weekly trends in content writes per minute or 95th percentile latency.  
- **REQ-019c:** Based on baseline metrics, SLAs will be set (e.g., "99.5% uptime per month', "95th percentile search latency < 300ms'). The system shall have alerts or at least logs when these SLA thresholds are breached (for instance, if uptime in last 24h dropped below 99%, or if an API call responded slower than SLA target, etc., possibly logged as warning).  
- **REQ-019d:** The system documentation shall include a section guiding how to determine these KPI baselines (like advising to run load tests and capture metrics [oai_citation:28â€¡radview.com](https://www.radview.com/blog/in-the-spotlight-the-sla-for-performance-and-load-testing/#:~:text=Performance%20Testing%20%20has%20become,in%20Performance%20and%20Load%20Testing)) and how to adjust system resources to meet SLAs (e.g. add more nodes if latency is creeping up). Essentially, the system should enable a culture of measurement.  
- **REQ-019e:** Optionally, provide an API or tool for an admin to retrieve current KPI status (like a `/api/stats` that returns current throughput, uptime). This could be used in a service review.  

While not a feature directly visible to end-users, this requirement ensures that the service quality can be managed proactively. Real-world usage data will refine KPIs; the initial SLA targets are derived from requirements (10k/min, 150ms, etc.) which themselves will be validated and possibly tuned when in production using performance testing [oai_citation:29â€¡radview.com](https://www.radview.com/blog/in-the-spotlight-the-sla-for-performance-and-load-testing/#:~:text=application%20will%20perform%20under%20excessive,foundation%20data%20for%20performance%20SLAs).  

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements  

*(Note: Some NFRs like performance and security have been interwoven above. This section reiterates or adds any NFRs not covered as discrete functional requirements.)*  

**REQ-020 - Scalability (Capacity and Concurrency):** The system **shall scale** to accommodate growing content volume and user traffic without significant degradation. It should handle an increasing number of content items (in the order of tens of thousands) and terms in ontology (thousands) with linear or sub-linear impact on query performance (appropriate indexes must be used in DBs to handle scale). In addition to throughput and concurrency (specified in REQ-016), the architecture should support scaling out major components (API stateless tier, perhaps separate the enrichment pipeline workers if needed). This ensures future growth can be managed by adding resources rather than complete redesign.  

**REQ-021 - Extensibility and Modularity:** The system design **shall be modular** such that new features or integrations can be added with minimal changes to existing components. For instance, if one wanted to integrate a different vector search engine, it should be a matter of implementing the embedding storage/retrieval interface for that engine. Or if a new enrichment step (like sentiment analysis on content) is desired, it could be inserted into the pipeline without overhaul. Use of open-source frameworks and standard protocols (REST, JSON, etc.) facilitates this. The codebase should separate concerns (e.g., a distinct module for enrichment logic vs API controllers vs data access) to ease maintenance.  

**REQ-022 - Portability (Container/K8s):** The platform **shall be portable** to various operating environments, by virtue of containerization. The provided Docker images and Kubernetes manifests will allow the system to be deployed on developer machines, on-prem servers, or any cloud that supports Docker/K8s with the same behavior. There should be no dependency on local filesystem paths (except mounted volumes), specific OS features, or GUI. Config should be adjustable via environment (for example, database connection strings, secret keys for JWT, etc.).  

**REQ-023 - Reliability and Availability:** The system **shall be reliable**, aiming for high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime as a goal if an SLA, meaning <45 minutes downtime per month). Redundancy and failover: if a node running the API goes down, other instances keep service available (hence load balanced setup). The databases should ideally be run in a fault-tolerant mode (Neo4j causal cluster, etc.) to avoid single point of failure for knowledge data. Automated backups of content (Document store and Neo4j) should be scheduled (e.g., nightly dumps) - an operational requirement to prevent data loss beyond X hours. The system should handle exceptions gracefully without crashing - e.g., if enrichment external call fails, log error but don't crash the whole pipeline runner.  

**REQ-024 - Maintainability:** The system **shall be maintainable**, which includes clear documentation of its components (for developers, plus user guide for admins/authors). Configuration management: maintain one configuration file or environment config doc to tweak common parameters (like maximum upload size, toggling certain features, etc.). Logging (as per REQ-015) helps maintainers debug issues. The code should be organized and commented to allow new developers to understand the flow (especially the critical pipeline). Automated tests should cover key functionality to catch regressions. Also, upgrades to underlying open-source dependencies should be manageable (for example, it should be possible to upgrade Neo4j or FastAPI version with minimal breakage, thanks to using standard query interfaces and not heavily modifying vendor code).  

**REQ-025 - Usability (Admin & Author Experience):** The platform **shall be user-friendly** for its intended user classes: Authors should have a clean, minimal interface to write content, with helpful features like real-time preview (if possible for Markdown) or at least a validation check before saving. Admin UI should logically group settings (schemas separate from ontology etc.) and provide guidance (like templates or examples when creating a new schema). Error messages aimed at users must be understandable ("The field 'Summary' is required' rather than a technical stack trace). For any technical error that cannot be shown to user, the UI should show a generic message but logs the detail. Also, for authoring specifically, consider the **Markdown vs YAML challenge**: if authors directly edit YAML front-matter, it's easy to make syntax mistakes [oai_citation:30â€¡chrisdaaz.github.io](https://chrisdaaz.github.io/static-web-scholcomm/tutorials/static-site-generators/#:~:text=YAML%20syntax%20is%20strict%3B%20invalid,an%20error%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20understand). Thus, to enhance usability, the system might hide raw YAML from typical authors - instead present input fields that generate YAML behind scenes. If a power user mode allows direct markdown+YAML editing, provide an integrated YAML validator or at least catch errors and show line numbers of issues [oai_citation:31â€¡chrisdaaz.github.io](https://chrisdaaz.github.io/static-web-scholcomm/tutorials/static-site-generators/#:~:text=YAML%20syntax%20is%20strict%3B%20invalid,an%20error%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20understand). Maybe integrate CodeMirror or similar for syntax highlighting of YAML to reduce errors. Essentially, these measures will reduce frustration.  

**REQ-026 - Interoperability:** The GKCMS **shall interoperate** with other systems via its API and standard formats. For example, if an external knowledge graph or AI service wants data, they can either call the API or consume the JSON-LD on the static site, which is a standardized format for knowledge [oai_citation:32â€¡yext.com](https://www.yext.com/platform/content#:~:text=). If required to push content to another system, data exports can be done in CSV, JSON, or RDF as appropriate. Using established vocabularies in JSON-LD (like schema.org) ensures external tools understand the content model. The reliance on open protocols (HTTP, OAuth2, etc.) means integration with enterprise infrastructure (SSO, monitoring, etc.) is smoother.  

**REQ-027 - Compliance and Standards:** The system **shall comply** with relevant standards and best practices. Security has been covered (OWASP ASVS L2). If the content domain requires certain standards (like Dublin Core metadata for documents, or certain taxonomies), the system should be flexible enough to incorporate those. Also, accessibility: if there is an admin UI, it should strive to be accessible (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation). The static site should produce accessible HTML (valid HTML5, alt tags for images if any, etc.). Performance optimization standards: follow best practices for web performance on the static site (like using CDN for static files, compressing assets, etc.). Logging standard: use ISO timestamp formats, etc.  

**REQ-028 - Testability:** The system **shall be testable**, meaning it should include or enable the creation of automated tests for its components. For example, unit tests for schema validation logic, integration tests that spin up an in-memory or test database and simulate content creation through to search retrieval to verify the pipeline works. The architecture (with distinct layers) allows injection of mocks for external services (like a dummy auth server or a stub for embedding generation) in a test environment. Furthermore, the presence of clear API endpoints means one can do end-to-end tests by hitting the API as a black box and checking outputs. This requirement ensures that as the system evolves, continuous integration can validate that new changes don't break existing functionality (particularly important given the complex interactions in enrichment and graph updates).  

This concludes the specific requirements for GKCMS. The next section provides supporting information such as glossary and acronyms used throughout. Each of the above requirements can be traced to one or more elements in the architecture diagrams or descriptions. Together, they specify a comprehensive set of capabilities and qualities for the platform.
