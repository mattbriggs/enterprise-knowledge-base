# Introduction

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define a complete Software/System Requirements Specification (SRS) for the **Open Knowledge Systems**. This platform is intended to manage structured content (in the form of "atomic containers') for use by both human users and AI agents. The SRS outlines the system's functionality, constraints, and quality requirements in compliance with IEEE 830 standards. It will serve as a reference for stakeholders (developers, testers, users, etc.) to understand what the system will do and the conditions under which it will operate.  

### 1.2 Scope  
The OKS platform enables an **author-first** (user-driven content creation) and **headless-first** (API-driven content management) workflow for managing structured content and knowledge. It will support content authoring, ingestion of external content, enrichment (metadata tagging and semantic embeddings), storage in multiple formats (YAML/JSON documents, vector database, and materialized knowledge graph), and delivery via both a static website and a RESTful API for external consumption. The scope of this SRS covers:  

- Functional capabilities including content schema management, validation rules, content creation interface, ingestion pipelines, content enrichment, static site generation with semantic markup, querying capabilities, and system monitoring.  
- Non-functional requirements such as performance (scalability and latency), extensibility (use of open-source components), portability (containerization), observability (logging, tracing, metrics), and security (adherence to OWASP ASVS Level 2, audit trails, RBAC).  
- System architecture description including main modules (Creation, Ingestion, Enrichment, etc.), data stores (schemas, rules, dictionaries, ontology, content storage, knowledge graph, etc.), and external interfaces (API, website, monitoring, authentication).  
- Constraints and assumptions, particularly differences between a local proof-of-concept deployment and a production deployment (e.g. authentication omitted in PoC but required in production).  

This SRS does **not** provide detailed design or implementation code; it focuses on requirements. Design diagrams are included to clarify system context, data flow, deployment, and data model, but they serve to illustrate requirements, not to dictate low-level design.  

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations  
- **Atomic Content Container (Container):** A fundamental unit of content managed by the system, consisting of structured data fields (stored in YAML/JSON) and associated metadata (including semantic vector embeddings and relationships in the knowledge graph). Each container has a unique ID, version, and provenance info (e.g. author or source).  
- **Schema:** A definition of a content type, including its structured fields and data types (comparable to a content model). Content containers must conform to a schema (also known as content type or template).  
- **Syntax Definition:** A set of rules or templates governing the format/markup of content items (e.g. a predefined syntax for how content is structured, possibly including templating or markdown usage rules).  
- **Rule:** A validation or business rule applied to content (e.g. ensuring required fields are present, or enforcing content quality constraints). Rules may be specific to a schema or global.  
- **Data Dictionary:** A repository of metadata about data elements. In this context, it provides definitions for structured data fields or business terms used in content. It ensures consistent meaning for fields across schemas (a data dictionary entry might describe what a field like "Title" means and how it's used).  
- **Terminology Store:** A controlled vocabulary of domain terms (keywords or phrases) that are relevant to the content domain. These terms could be topics, tags, or glossary terms that appear in content.  
- **Domain Ontology:** A structured representation of knowledge for the domain, often hierarchical (e.g. categories, sub-categories, and terms) and semantic relationships between terms. In this system, the ontology may be designed in an external tool (Protégé) but stored internally as nodes and relationships in the knowledge graph (e.g. "Category' and "Term' nodes with "subcategory-of' or "is-a' relationships).  
- **Knowledge Graph (KG):** A graph data representation that links content, terms, and concepts. The platform will "materialize' a knowledge graph, meaning content and ontology are stored as interconnected nodes/edges (e.g. a content container node linked to term nodes that it mentions, term nodes linked to category nodes, etc.).  
- **Static Site Builder:** The component that generates a static website (HTML pages, likely with JSON-LD embedded) from the content in the system for human browsing. JSON-LD is used to embed structured data (knowledge graph context) into pages for SEO and AI consumption.  
- **JSON-LD:** JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data, a format to embed structured data in web pages. The platform uses JSON-LD in generated pages to expose the knowledge graph information (e.g. schema.org annotations) about content, which helps search engines and AI understand the content context [oai_citation:0‡yext.com](https://www.yext.com/platform/content#:~:text=).  
- **REST API:** The web service interface (based on HTTP/JSON, likely implemented via FastAPI) through which external applications or AI agents can query or manipulate content and knowledge in a headless manner.  
- **OAuth 2.0:** An industry-standard protocol for authorization. The platform will use OAuth 2.0 for securing the API in production (e.g. issuing tokens to clients and validating scopes/permissions).  
- **Provenance:** Metadata about the origin of a content item (who created it, when, and from what source).  
- **Embedding (Vector Embedding):** A numeric vector representation of content (usually generated by an AI model) that captures semantic meaning, enabling similarity search. The platform stores an embedding for each content container to support semantic search queries.  
- **Telemetry:** Monitoring data collected from the system, including logs, metrics, and traces of operations. Telemetry is used for observing system behavior and performance (e.g. capturing usage analytics, error rates, response times).  
- **RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control, a method of regulating system access based on roles assigned to users (e.g. author, admin, reader roles with different permissions).  
- **PoC:** Proof of Concept - a minimal deployment of the system used to verify concepts (in this case, a local deployment using open-source components).  

*Note:* Additional acronyms are listed in section [4.2](#42-acronyms-and-abbreviations). Terms specific to content management and knowledge graphs are further explained in the [Glossary](#41-glossary-of-terms).

### 1.5 Overview  
The rest of this SRS document is organized as follows: **Section 2** provides a high-level description of the OKS system, its context, major components, and operating environment. This includes illustrative diagrams for context, data flow, deployment, and data models to help visualize the system architecture and workflows. **Section 3** enumerates the specific requirements - functional requirements detail the expected features and behaviors of the system, while non-functional requirements specify performance targets, security standards, and other quality attributes. Each requirement is labeled with a unique identifier (REQ-***###***) for traceability. **Section 4** contains appendices, including a glossary of key terms to clarify domain-specific language and an acronym list. The goal is to ensure clarity and completeness so that stakeholders and developers can proceed with design, implementation, and testing with a shared understanding of the system's requirements.
